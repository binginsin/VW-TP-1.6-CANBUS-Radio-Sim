# VW TP 1.6 CANBUS Radio/Phone simulator

This code pretends to be a radio/phone/satnav on a VW car that uses Transport Protocol 1.6 and has a non-color MFD (Multi Function Display).

I had it working at one point but gave up as I was attempting to make a bluetooth player that displays songs and stuff, but the bluetooth player and packaging was too much of a hassle.

I did get this to run on a custom board that talks to the CANBUS and got it displaying on the MFD.
